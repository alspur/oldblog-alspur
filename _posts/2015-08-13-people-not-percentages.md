We're a week removed from the first debate of the 2016 Republican primary, and I'm starting to re-think my initial analysis: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The morning after <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOPDebate?src=hash">#GOPDebate</a>, I’d still say Rubio did the best. Bush did well responding to tough q’s, but he didn’t hit any home runs.</p>&mdash; Alex Spurrier (@alspur) <a href="https://twitter.com/alspur/status/629629800584466432">August 7, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Walker was indeed “aggressively normal”, Kasich did well in front of the hometown crowd, but I doubt either will get a sig. bump <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOPDebate?src=hash">#GOPDebate</a></p>&mdash; Alex Spurrier (@alspur) <a href="https://twitter.com/alspur/status/629630455495716864">August 7, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

FiveThirtyEight's [post-debate poll analysis][postdebatepolls] backs up my first point: Rubio had the strongest primetime performance. It also confirmed my final points: while Kasich looked good, he's polling about the same as he did pre-debate, and that Walker's middle-of-the-road performance wouldn't improve his standing. However, my assessment of Bush seems to be more charitable than most poll respondents. 

I still think that Bush did a decent job communicating his stances on immigration reform and Common Core. A large bloc of the Republican base doesn't trust him right now on these issues, but he's getting more opportunities to show how his positions are grounded in conservative principles. If he continues to make his case on these issues [as well as he did at the RedState Gathering][rsg], it would go a long way torwards getting the base to trust him.

However, I think the debate also revealed a more critical flaw in Jeb's messaging. This is what I'm talking about:

I'm sorry, but even as an economics major, the notion of 4 percent growth isn't all that motivating, and [one of Jeb's rivals is already exploiting this weakness][kasich]:

>Kasich has Bush in his sights, though he won’t admit it. The former Florida governor has frequently promised on the trail to deliver 4 percent economic growth as president. At the August 3 forum, Kasich took what sounded like a swipe at Bush, saying “I think that economic growth is not just an end unto itself,” before calling for Republicans to reach out to Americans living “in the shadows.” The next day, speaking with reporters, he shook his head at the suggestion he was targeting Bush. “I was trying to figure out how anybody thought I was doing that,” said Kasich. “It wasn’t a slap at anybody.”

Kasich is absolutely right. In [*The Conservative Heart*][brooks], Arthur Brooks urges conservatives to "fight for people, not against things." That doesn't come through in the main message of Jeb's campaign and it's why his debate performance didn't resonate with many voters.

Jeb is capable of doing much better. Take a minute to watch him talk about education:

His passion to fight for kids is clear, genuine, and would certainly appeal to many people across the political spectrum. Jeb needs to strike that same tone on the economy — he needs to start talking about people, not percentages.
