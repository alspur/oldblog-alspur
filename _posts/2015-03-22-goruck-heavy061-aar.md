This St. Patrick's Day weekend in Boston, I completed my first [GORUCK Heavy][heavy]. It was easily the most difficult and most rewarding event I've done. The following is an After-Action Review (AAR) of my experience during GORUCK Heavy 061.

> So what is the GORUCK Heavy? GORUCK Heavy is a team event lasting no less than 24 hours and covering a minimum of 35 miles.

>You are no longer individuals - you are a team. You mission is to get everybody to complete all the events to the standard outlined by the cadre.

>In order to be a good leader, you have to be an excellent follower. To lead is to serve. Nothing more, nothing less.

Heading up to Boston for the event, I was excited. I rode with two other guys from Connecticut that were also planning on going for an HCL - a Heavy, a Challenge, and a Light. We were all attempting our first Heavy, and we all figured if we could make it through 24 hours, there was a good chance of following it up with another 18 hours of events.  

It sounds crazy, but that was the plan. 

We arrived in Boston just before 4pm, leaving us with five hours to kill before the fun began. After an early dinner, I sat in a Starbucks trying to kill time and keep my adrenaline from spiking too early in the evening. 

---

From 8:40 to 9:00pm, a group of more than 30 other participants in the GORUCK Heavy congregated at the George Washington statue in the [Boston Public Garden][garden]. We were all feeling some combination of excitement and jitters as we saw Cadre Andy (a.k.a Top) appear.

Top walked us through his background: he's been a Marine for more than 15 years, is a [MARSOC][marsoc] plank owner[^1], and an all-around badass. Earlier in the week, his command lost [seven Marines during a training exercise in Florida][helicopter]. It was a sobering reminder of the risks and  sacrifices our service members take every day, and it helped me get my mind right for the task at hand.

---

We very quickly moved to the first portion of the event: a 12-mile timed ruck along the Charles River. Top told us that he would leave about 5 minutes after we started, holding just over a 15 minute per mile pace. If he caught up to you, it meant you were in danger of not finishing within the 3:30 time limit.

Once we started the ruck, it was actually kind of nice. We had great views of the Boston skyline and while it was cold (mid-30's), after about four miles I was sweating so much, I had to shed my outer layer, hat, and gloves. We were all talking, getting to know one another as we moved when fewer than three miles in, Top caught up to us.

He was not pleased. I don't remember his exact words, but he yelled at us for spending too much time running our mouths and not focusing on the task at had. This was the first moment when I thought to myself that this may be a lot harder than I imagined.

Our pace picked up pretty quickly after that encounter. I stayed towards the front of the pack to make sure I would make the time cut. We followed a pattern of fast walking for a few hundred yards, followed by a light jog for another few hundred yards. 

This continued until about the seventh mile in when all of the sudden, the sidewalk ended. Knowing we had to stick along the river, we made our way across a stream and through about a mile of snow before the sidewalk reappeared. 

At this point, I wasn't sure if I was going to make it through the entire event. I'd never rucked this far at this pace before, and I was having my doubts about my ability to finish the event. I tried to quiet those thoughts by focusing on finishing the 12 miles - I could worry about the rest of the event later.

We arrived at the finish point with about a half hour to spare. This gave us much needed time to tend to our feet. I stripped off my boots and socks to check for blisters and let my feet dry out a little. Thankfully, I wasn't developing any blisters.

After applying some Gold Bond and enjoying a quick snack, I was ready to go as the final people finished the 12 mile ruck. A handful that didn't make the time limit decided to withdraw from the event. They wouldn't be the last to make that choice.

Typically, the next portion of the PT test would be the [Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT)][apft]. GORUCK HQ is working on updating the format of the Heavy, so we had the opportunity to try out a different test, known as [Operator Ugly][opugly]. Our group then headed to a gym owned by one of our participants, [Rx Strength Training][rx], to meet Cadre Aaron and complete a series of lifts, sprints, and sandbag getups. 

The gym was a few miles away, so we rucked our way over. Getting inside was a welcome treat, but it was even better to get our boots off and do most of the test barefoot. My feet were killing me at this point and it was nice to let them breathe a little more.

I really enjoyed this portion of the event. During each round of the Operator Ugly, we started to encourage and push one another a little more than we did the previous round. It was the first sign of our team coming together, but we still had a long way to go. 

---

Once the Operator Ugly was complete, we got our gear back on and formed three ranks in the gym parking lot. Cadre Aaron instructed me and one other person to collect the food from all of the rucks and place them in two sandbags. I botched the collection process and we all paid for it with some flutter kicks, burpees, and pushups. It sucked to know that I screwed up and that everyone was paying for it. At this time, I stopped thinking about completing an HCL - I was hoping to just make it through the Heavy. 

We then had to run around the block in three minutes as a team. It was a rather icy block with a hill at the end that felt brutal when trying to move up it with a 40+ pound ruck. We failed to get it right the first time. The second attempt, we failed again. The third time, someone fell pretty hard after hitting an ice patch. 

I think we finally finished after our fourth  or fifth attempt, but it all started to blur together for me at this point. On our last attempt, I was actually thinking about quitting if we had to run the block one more time. 

My will was being seriously tested at this point in the night, but I pushed myself onward.

---

At this point, we got back in formation in the parking lot and I was starting to feel smoked. My legs were starting to feel the cumulative effect of the miles and weight, and we were maybe six hours into the event.  

Top outlined our first mission: to move sensitive materials located inside the embassy (the gym) to a secure extraction point a few miles away. We had a short amount of time to retrieve the materials (two logs weighing a combined 800 pounds and a half dozen kettlebells weighing 35-65 pounds) and get moving towards the extraction point. 

The Cadre picked a team leader for us, making it clear that they were selected because they looked like the least likely to succeed as a team leader. This sounds harsh, but it's actually something I've come to love about GORUCK events because: 

1. People less naturally inclined towards leadership are forced to step outside their comfort zone.
2. The rest of the team needs to rally behind the team leader to help them succeed and prove the Cadre wrong.

We got moving and then the rain started. There was still ice everywhere, and as a team, we weren't working very well together. I spent a lot of time on the bigger of the two logs, which must have weighed in above 500 pounds and could only be carried by three people. We struggled to figure out how to rotate people carrying the two logs, and as a result, we moved at a snail's pace.

We didn't make our time goal to the first "extraction point", nor did we make our second. Our punishment: more PT. Once we got moving again, the Cadre didn't relent, pushing us to figure it out move faster at every chance they could. 

It took us a while to get a system of teams rotating in on each type of weight, but when we did, we started moving at a much faster pace. I started to feel better too. The rain and cold weren't ideal, but I felt better as I saw our team start to come together under the stress of the weight, time goals, and the elements.

At some point later in the morning (by now, my sense of time was completely off), we arrived at a turf field for our next PT evaluation, the [Marine Corps Combat Fitness Test][cft]. There was a Quidditch game happening on one half of the field and we took the unoccupied half. I'm still not sure which group looked more strange to the joggers that would pass by.

The Combat Fitness Test was administered in two parts. First, we had two minutes to get maximum reps of presses (strict or push) with a 35 pound kettlebell. The second portion was a mini-obstacle course that involved running, crawling, fireman's carries, and even a faux grenade toss. 

Only a few people at a time could perform the test, leaving the rest of us to stand around in the rain. We were all feeling the elements much more once we stopped moving, so we started using penguin huddles to keep one another warm.

The actual test was pretty fun. My legs felt like jelly at this point, even more so when attempting to run with a 200 pound man on my shoulders, but with Cadre Andy and my teammates cheering me on, I moved much faster than I thought I would.

The next 12 hours or so were mostly a painful blur of log carrying and PT, but there were some bright spots. 

We carried the logs for a few more miles, and when we finally made a time hack, we were rewarded by having Cadre Aaron join us in some PT outside of a train station. The exercises weren't predictable in their rep counts - it seemed like we never finished sets on the same number of reps, or even on round numbers. In my head, I just started to assume we would do 100 reps of each exercise, so that when we stopped after 73, it felt like I was getting extra rest. 

At this point, I was trying every mental trick I could to keep myself in a positive mindset, but at least once every hour, I thought about quitting. 

We then carried the logs some more and found shelter from the rain in front of a Dunkin Donuts.  Our group morale was bottoming out. We were so wet and so cold that it seemed like we were all on the verge of hypothermia. I think Cadre Aaron picked up on this and did two things to help us out. First, he had us sing a summer camp-style song about how hot it was in Boston. It didn't warm me up very much, but it did perk our spirits up a little.

The next part was much more effective. Cadre Aaron gave two of our teammates a food-related challenge: if they could each chug a large iced coffee with cream in 30 seconds, he would buy everyone a hot, fresh donut. I don't think I was ever happier to have a glazed donut in my life. 

Those bright spots helped me push through my doubts about finishing the event. We had a few more people drop out, and I thought about quitting more than I'd like to admit. In the end, I didn't want to disappoint the people around me - my teammates - by quitting.

As night began to fall, we added a few more items of weight: two massive chunks of granite. The rain poured down as we made our way through downtown Boston, up a steep hill that reached its apex at the Massachusetts State House. We were moving slowly and every part of my body was aching. Our rotations on the logs were getting shorter and shorter and it seemed like we wold never make it up the hill, but we just kept moving forward.

Once we reached the State House, we made our way downhill on to the Common. I started to notice more shadows[^2] and I knew that we were closing in on the finish. Before I knew it, we moved inside the parking garage underneath the Common for our endex (end of exercise).

The GORUCK Heavy lived up to its billing - it is the ultimate team event. It may be cliché, but we started as individuals and finished as a team. 

I decided to not attempt the HCL, which I still regret a little, but I think I made the right choice based on how my body felt at the time. I had no idea I'd be able to push my mind and body that far and I know that it was only possible because of the people standing beside me. A huge thanks to Cadre Andy and Cadre Aaron for their service and for making this such a great experience.
