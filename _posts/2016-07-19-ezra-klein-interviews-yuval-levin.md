This is a thoughtful, in-depth conversation that covers from the thesis of Levin's latest book, [The Fractured Republic](https://www.amazon.com/Fractured-Republic-Renewing-America%C2%92s-Individualism/dp/0465061966), his experience working in the Bush (43) Administration, the most interesting policy ideas on each side of the political spectrum, and more. 

This is the first [Ezra Klein Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611) episode I've listened to - I'm looking forward to adding others to my [Overcast](http://overcast.fm) queue.
