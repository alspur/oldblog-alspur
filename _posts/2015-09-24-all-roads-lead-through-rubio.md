Leon Wolf thinks Rubio is the candidate to beat: 

>“People and pundits will talk about the differences between the various campaign organizations, and fundraising prowess, and cash on hand, and campaign strategy. That is all fine and well and good – we are in the business of commenting upon and observing all those things here at RedState.
>
>But at the end of the day, there is absolutely no substitute for a good and talented candidate – and there is no way for even the best of campaigns to overcome a bad one. And for whatever missteps or organizational shortcomings (or lack of funds) the Rubio campaign presently has, the simple fact is that he probably belongs in the discussion with Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton as to who is the most naturally gifted politician of the last 50 years. Which is why, regardless of what the polls say now, if I were a betting man, I would wager heavily on Marco Rubio walking away from this thing as the eventual nominee – especially now that Trump has essentially cleared the field of his main competition in Florida.

>Let me also add, for the sake of clarity, that Rubio would not be my first choice and I’m not even arguing that he should win the nomination. I am just predicting that he will – and I am increasingly confident making that prediction every day that goes by.”

I started to feel this way after the first debate and after watching the second debate, I strongly agree with Wolf's assessment - I think Rubio has the best shot at winning the nomination. I'll go a step further and add that I think he *should* win the nomination. 

At the start of the race, I thought that Jeb had the strongest policy platform and would be the most prepared candidate, with Rubio as a close second. However, a
 political talent is as important (if not more important) than executive talent in an election. If you can't win, your ability to govern well is irrelevant. 

The central flaw in Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign was that while he undoubtedly would have done an outstanding as president, as a candidate, he failed to effectively communicate his core message to voters. I fear that nominating Jeb in 2016 would repeat this same mistake, since he would almost certainly spend far too much time defending or distancing himself from 41 and 43 instead of how he would govern as 45.

Right now, I'm convinced that Rubio would give our party the best combination of policy chops and political talent for the 2016 general election. As the lesser candidates drop out of the primary, I'm hopeful that my fellow Republicans will ultimately make the right choice and nominate Rubio.
