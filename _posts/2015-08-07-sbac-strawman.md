In [post not too long ago][moardata], I wrote about the need for more thoughtful, transparent, and rigorous data analysis of education data in Connecticut. It was disappointing to see one of our state's superintendents [publish an opinion piece][scarice] advocating for reducing the role of data. 

The author paints a pretty depressing picture of the role data plays in our schools. For example, there this: 

>Yet the educational community --the very field that finds its existence in the care and welfare of children, particularly where “the story” matters most -- continues to kneel and bow at the altar of big data, any data that can be captured, with flagrant disregard for its importance or meaning.

...and this:

>Sadly, too many teachers have been trapped in mindless data exercises that irresponsibly neglect the story behind the numbers, turning children into faceless numbers… hence dehumanizing the sacred process of fostering the growth and development of our children.

Is anyone actually advocating, let alone practicing, the kind of mindless devotion to data the author describes? I doubt it. I'm also not aware of a single person promising, as the author asserts, that the SBAC test will "revolutionize schooling", or arguing that we should ever examine a single data point without any contextual information.

There's plenty to critique when it comes to Common Core/SBAC and/or top-down, standards-driven accountability policies,[^1] but an article full of straw men doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the conversation. 

I'm not as confident as Superintendent Scarice that the results of the SBAC test can be swept away as meaningless before the public has a chance to digest the information on their own. As he notes, we have a decent amount of contextual data on our schools (SAT, college acceptance rates, etc.). The SBAC results might tell a story similar to what we already know, or they may reveal new insights. 

In either case, we deserve the opportunity to make our own judgements instead of dismissing new information based on weak arguments.
